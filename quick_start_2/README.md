## CircRNAFlow Quick Start for DSL2

ðŸš§This is not supported. See ../quick_start/README.md until this DSL2 is more supported.ðŸš§


This "quick start" for the DSL2 version of the CircRNAflow pipline provides a step-by-step method along with test data to execute a test run of the pipeline.

So far the pipeline is developed and tested with *SLURM* and *local* executors with containers (either *docker* or *singularity*).  This quick-start is intended for using SLURM, but by changing the profile, docker containers or the local executor could be used!

### Quick Start Steps For Using the SLURM executor and singularity containers

1.  Download to this directory the test data from Zenodo using this *link* or this command:

```
wget LINK
```

2.   Unpack the test data to reveal directories for: a) sample data, b) pipeline/configuration data, c) reference data, and d) singularity image files.

```
tar -xvzf NAME
```
3. Create symlinks to the DSL2 code:
```
ln -vs ../modules
ln -vs ../circRNAFlow.DSL2.nf
```
4. Create an SBATCH file which will run the pipeline.  The example below is available to be edited and customized:
```

```
**NOTE**: *be sure* to customize the directories/paths in the file so that they exist on your system and so that they point to this clone of the repo.
